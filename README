This project is a complete rewrite of preallowed.com. It offers the same rich functionality for distributed Role Based Access Control Web 2.0 service. It uses MondoDB as a data store, which is going to make it super fast (a crucial quality for a distributed RBAC service to have) and scalable beyond ones imagination. It will also implement OAuth provider which is becoming industry standard these days (still work in progress -- stay tuned).
